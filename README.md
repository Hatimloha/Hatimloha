# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Hatim!

I am a DevOps Engineer with a passion for automation and cloud technologies. I've worked extensively with tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, AWS, and more. Iâ€™ve created multiple repositories filled with DevOps scripts and projects that can be used for learning and practical implementation.

## Key Repositories:
- **DevOps Scripts**: A collection of scripts for daily tasks, such as system monitoring, automated backups, log management, and service health checks.
- **Terraform Projects**: Learn and apply Infrastructure-as-Code with my Terraform projects.
- **Kubernetes Automation**: Automate your Kubernetes cluster tasks with these ready-to-use scripts.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Explore Jenkins and GitHub Actions workflows for seamless code deployments.

You can use these repositories to get hands-on experience and accelerate your learning in DevOps. Dive in, explore, and contribute!
